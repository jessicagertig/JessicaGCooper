## Jessica G. Cooper 

Hello 👋, I'm a full stack web developer skilled in JavaScript, React, Node, Python, HTML and CSS. Passionate about creating useful, attractive, and intuitive front end user interfaces. As a full stack developer, I'm invested in owning a feature or product from end to end and I love the satisfaction of building a RESTful API which serves the frontend both efficiently and effectively. I get energized through harnessing both creativity and analytical thinking to find solutions to complex problems.

When not coding, I am training my rambunctious German Shepherd puppy 🐕   and dreaming up designs for gorgeous quilts ✂️
